This is a simple scraper showing you how to use PhantomJS with Ruby.
Here's what it does:

1. Visits the morph.io home page
2. Because the headless browser is a small window it now has to click the button to open the navigation menu so we can see the search box
3. It enters a search for "planningalerts" into the search box and clicks the submit button
4. After waiting for the results to appear (see the important gotcha in the code comments!) it outputs the full names of all the scrapers on the search results page
